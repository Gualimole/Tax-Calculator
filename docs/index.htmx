<h3>What is Tax-Calculator?</h3>

<p>
  Tax-Calculator is an open-source microsimulation model for
  static analysis of USA federal income and payroll taxes.
</p>

<p>
  When using
  <a href="https://github.com/PSLmodels/taxdata#about-taxdata-repository">
    micro data</a> that represent the USA population, Tax-Calculator can
  estimate the aggregate revenue and distributional effects of tax
  reforms under static analysis assumptions.

<p>
  Tax-Calculator can also process custom-created data on one or more
  filing units permitting analysis of how tax reforms affect certain
  people.
</p>

<p>
  Tax-Calculator interacts with other models in the
  <a href="https://www.pslmodels.org/">Policy Simulation Library</a>
  to conduct non-static analysis.
</p>

<h3>Latest Release</h3>

<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/RELEASES.md#2019-04-17-release-201">
    2.0.1 (2019-04-17)</a>    
</p>

<p>
  If already using Tax-Calculator, upgrade using the following command:
</p>
<pre>
  conda update -c PSLmodels taxcalc
</pre>

<p>
  If just getting started, read
  <a href="tc_starting.html">these instructions</a>.

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<p>
  Results will change as Tax-Calculator data and logic improve. A
  fundamental reason for adopting open-source methods in this project
  is so that people from all backgrounds can contribute to the models
  that our society uses to assess economic policy; when
  community-contributed improvements are incorporated, the model will
  produce different results.
</p>
