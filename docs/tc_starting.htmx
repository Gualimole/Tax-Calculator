<!-- #NAVBAR# -->

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>
  Tax-Calculator packages are available for Windows, Mac, and Linux
  computers that have the free Anaconda Python 3.6 or 3.7 distribution
  installed.  You can use Tax-Calculator without doing any Python
  programming, but the Anaconda distribution is required for
  Tax-Calculator to run.  Take the following steps to get started.
</p>

<h5>1. Install Anaconda Python</h5>

<p>
  Download and install the free Anaconda distribution of Python 3.6 or
  3.7 from <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">Anaconda</a>.
  You must do this even if you already have Python installed on your
  computer because the Anaconda distribution contains all the
  additional Python packages that Tax-Calculator uses to conduct its
  calculations (many of which are not included in other Python
  installations).  You can install the Anaconda distribution without
  having administrative privileges on your computer and the Anaconda
  distribution will not interfere with any Python installation that
  came as part of your computer's operating system.
</p>

<h5>2. Download Tax-Calculator Package</h5>

<p>
  Download a Tax-Calculator <kbd>taxcalc</kbd> package for your
  computer by executing this command from the command prompt:
  <pre>
    conda install -c PSLmodels taxcalc
  </pre>
  This command will also install all the Python packages required by
  Tax-Calculator.
</p>

<h5>3. Read Tax-Calculator User Guide</h5>

<p>
  Read the <a href="uguide.html">user guide</a> about how to conduct
  tax analysis with Tax-Calculator and how to join the Tax-Calculator
  community so that you can ask questions, report bugs, and request
  enhancements.
