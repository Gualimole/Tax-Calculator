    "# Recipe 5: Redefining Expanded Income\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an advanced recipe that should be followed only after mastering the basic recipe.\n",
    "This recipe is almost exactly the same as Directly Comparing Two Reforms, so you might want to read that recipe first.\n",
    "\n",
    "This recipe introduces a powerful technique for customizing the operation of Tax-Calculator.\n",
    "This calculator-customization technique is used in this recipe to redefine expanded income in a way that allows the\n",
    "redefined income measure to be used seamlessly with all the other (table and graph) methods of the Calculator class.\n",
    "The basic idea behind the calculator-customization technique is to derive a customized Calculator class from the Tax-Calculator Calculator class.\n",
    "This is a standard [object-oriented programming]([https://pslmodels.github.io/Tax-Calculator/tc_overview.html](https://pslmodels.github.io/Tax-Calculator/tc_overview.html)) technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recipe that illustrates how to customize the taxcalc Calculator class so that\n",
    "it can seamlessly use an alternative definition of expanded income.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique for doing this customization is standard in object-oriented\n",
    "programming: a child class is derived from a parent class and then customized.\n",
    "The derived child class inherits all the data and methods of the parent class,\n",
    "but can be customized by adding new data and methods or by overriding inherited\n",
    "methods."
