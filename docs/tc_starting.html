<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>
  Tax-Calculator packages are available for Windows, Mac, and Linux
  computers that have the free Anaconda Python 3.6 or 3.7 distribution
  installed.  You can use Tax-Calculator without doing any Python
  programming, but the Anaconda distribution is required for
  Tax-Calculator to run.  Take the following steps to get started.
</p>

<h5>1. Install Anaconda Python</h5>

<p>
  Download and install the free Anaconda distribution of Python 3.6 or
  3.7 from <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/"
  target="_blank">Anaconda</a>.  You must do this even if you already
  have Python installed on your computer because the Anaconda
  distribution contains all the additional Python packages that
  Tax-Calculator uses to conduct its calculations (many of which are
  not included in other Python installations).  You can install the
  Anaconda distribution without having administrative privileges on
  your computer and the Anaconda distribution will not interfere with
  any Python installation that came as part of your computer's
  operating system.
</p>

<h5>2. Download Tax-Calculator Package</h5>

<p>
  Download a Tax-Calculator <kbd>taxcalc</kbd> package for your
  computer by executing this command from the command prompt:
  <pre>
    conda install -c PSLmodels taxcalc
  </pre>
  This command will also install all the Python packages required by
  Tax-Calculator.
</p>

<h5>3. Read Tax-Calculator User Guide</h5>

<p>
  Read the <a href="uguide.html" target="_blank">user guide</a> about
  how to conduct tax analysis with Tax-Calculator and how to join the
  Tax-Calculator community so that you can ask questions, report bugs,
  and request enhancements.
