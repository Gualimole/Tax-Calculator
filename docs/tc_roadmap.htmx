<h3>Future Directions</h3>

<p>
  Tax-Calculator development has both near-term and long-term objectives.
</p>

<h4>Near-Term Objective</h4>

<p>
  The near-term objective is the development of other modules that can
  be used along with Tax-Calculator to conduct non-static tax analysis
  that generates both aggregate and distributional reform results.
  Three other modules are planned:
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/PSLmodels/Behavioral-Responses#behavioral-responses"
     target="_blank">Partial-equilibrium Behavioral-Response</a>
  capabilities have been completed.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/PSLmodels/Business-Taxation#business-taxation"
     target="_blank">Business-Taxation</a> capabilities are being
  developed that will permit the effects of reforms in (corporate
  and pass-through) business taxes to feed back to filing-unit
  incomes, and therefore, individual taxes, in Tax-Calculator as
  envisioned in
  <a href="https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/issues/1515#issuecomment-329620209"
     target="">this note</a>.
</p>

<p>
  A <em>Macro-Feedback</em> capability is being planned that will
  allow the macroeconomic growth effects of a tax reform to feed back
  to filing-unit incomes, and therefore, individual taxes, in
  Tax-Calculator.
</p>

<p>
  Once Tax-Calculator can support these other modules, it is anticipated
  that the public application programming interface (API) of
  Tax-Calculator will be stable.
</p>

<h4>Long-Term Objectives</h4>

<p>
  Fix bugs in tax-calculation logic.
</p>
<p>
  Add new policy parameters to enable parametric simulation of new reforms.
</p>
<p>
  Add actual policy parameter values as they become available each year.
</p>
<p>
  Update filing-unit data used by Tax-Calculator as they become available.
</p>
<p>
  Improve model documentation.
