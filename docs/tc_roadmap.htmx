<h3>Future Directions</h3>

<p>
  Because Tax-Calculator itself does only static analysis of federal
  individual income and payroll taxes, it must interact with other
  models in order to analyze business taxes or conduct non-static
  analysis.  These other models typically use Tax-Calculator to
  estimate reform-induced changes in after-tax incomes and marginal
  tax rates, and then use that information to calculate how other
  taxes or non-static behavior cause changes in individual incomes or
  expenses, which are then fed back to Tax-Calculator so that
  individual tax liabilities, as well as aggregate and distribution
  results, can be recalculated.  All these interactions between
  Tax-Calculator and other models are handled by

<p>
  The <b>future development of Tax-Calculator</b> itself will focus on
  the following activities:
</p>  
  <p style="margin-left: 10px">
    Fix bugs in tax-calculation logic.
  </p>  
  <p style="margin-left: 10px">
    Add new policy parameters to enable parametric simulation of new reforms.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 10px">
    Add actual policy parameter values as they become available each year.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 10px">
    Update filing-unit data used by Tax-Calculator as they become available.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 10px">
    Add ability to use publicly-available synthetic filing-unit data
    derived from a recent IRS-SOI PUF file.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 10px">
    Improve documentation of model logic and data.
